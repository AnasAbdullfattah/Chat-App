# Chat-App

**Note #1**: it took sometime to know what will I use exactly in building this project
Backend: Express, Mongoose, Dotenv, Jsonwebtoken, bcryptjs, cookie-parser cloudinary and finally Socket.io
Frontend: React, Tailwind, Zustand and Daisy UI
**Note #2**: I read about the diffrence between the typrs CommonJS and Modules
**Note #3**: the best code is the readble one since that help in maintaingin it in the future to develop and for others
to contirbute
**Note #4**: with git don't worry if you missed things up, because there is always a checkpoint
to return to as if you are in a game
Note #5: DON'T FORGET TO ADD NODE_MODULES TO .gitignore please
